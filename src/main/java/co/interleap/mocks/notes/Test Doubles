Car Crash Example

When A car company wants to test the impact of a car crash they do not use real humans they use crash test dummys (which
we can call test doubles). They look like human beings but they are not actually humans. The dummy's have censors that
give data back to the car manufacture and the car manufacture use that data to justify there claims that there car is
safe.

The same thing can be done with Test Doubles in code. You duplicate a class etc.... and confirm some that the code is
doing what it is suppose to do based on the output from the test double which is meant to act like a real class.

Test Double can also be called mocks.
